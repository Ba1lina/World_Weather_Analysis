# World_Weather_Analysis
 
Within this repo there are two notebooks; WeatherPy & VacationPy.

WeatherPy
In the first notebook I run code to pick out over 600+ cities using citipy and randomly generated longtitude and latitude figures.
Then using the random cities chosen I pull the weather data for the current data from the Open Weather Map.
Run some analyses on the correlation between a cities Latitude and other factors and then export the list.

VacationPy
In this notebook I take the list of cities generated from WeatherPy and generate a Heatmap based on Humidity using the Google Maps API.
I then narrow down the list of cities to those that are my goldilocks places to visit. Including the fact that I want to travel overseas and so no cities within Australia.
